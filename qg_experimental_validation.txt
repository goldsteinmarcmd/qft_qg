Conclusion:
-----------------------
QG effects are NOT expected to be detectable at HL-LHC with current methods.
The most promising avenue for detecting QG effects is through dilepton_mass.
Current gravitational wave detectors lack the sensitivity needed to detect QG effects.

These results are based on the theoretical framework with appropriate systematic uncertainties.
Future experimental facilities with higher energy or precision may improve detection prospects.
