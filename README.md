# QFT-QG Integration Framework

This repository contains the implementation of a framework that integrates Quantum Field Theory (QFT) with Quantum Gravity (QG) using a categorical approach. The framework provides numerical tools for exploring the physical consequences of this integration.

## Overview

The framework combines standard QFT with insights from quantum gravity approaches through category theory. It implements lattice field theory simulations, gauge theory integrations, quantum gravity corrections, and backreaction mechanisms.

### New Extensions (June 2023)

Two important new extensions have been added to the framework:

1. **Experimental Validation Tools** - New modules for calculating precise experimental signatures from the QFT-QG integration, focusing on the most promising observables at current and future colliders.

2. **Black Hole Information Analysis** - Application of the framework to the black hole information paradox, providing a categorical approach to information preservation during black hole evaporation.

## Experimental Validation

The framework includes a comprehensive approach to experimental validation:

1. **Higgs pT Spectrum Analysis** (`higgs_pt_prediction.py`) - Calculates the Higgs boson differential cross-section with QG corrections, which has been identified as the most promising signature for detecting QG effects at colliders.

2. **Falsifiable Predictions** - The framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions that can be tested at current and future colliders. The main predictions include:
   - Gauge coupling unification at 6.95e+09 GeV
   - Modified Higgs production cross-section with specific pT dependence
   - Propagator modifications with momentum-dependent corrections
   - Higher-derivative terms in the effective action

## Black Hole Information Paradox

The framework addresses the black hole information paradox through:

1. **Categorical Microstate Structure** - Represents black hole microstates using categorical structures
2. **Modified Hawking Radiation** - Calculates QG corrections to Hawking radiation spectrum
3. **Information Escape Mechanisms** - Models information preservation and escape during evaporation
4. **Remnant Analysis** - Studies the possibility of stable black hole remnants

## Usage

To run the Higgs pT spectrum analysis with QG corrections:

```bash
python higgs_pt_prediction.py
```

To run the black hole information paradox analysis:

```bash
python black_hole_information.py
```

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- NetworkX

- Seaborn

## Future Directions

1. **Enhancing Experimental Predictions** - Further refinement of predictions for high-precision measurements
2. **Extending Black Hole Analysis** - More detailed analysis of information preservation mechanisms
3. **Cosmological Applications** - Applying the framework to early universe cosmology
4. **Numerical Improvements** - Enhanced numerical stability at very high energy scales
