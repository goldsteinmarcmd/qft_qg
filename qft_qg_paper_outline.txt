TITLE: A Categorical Approach to Integrating Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity

ABSTRACT:
We present a novel mathematical framework for integrating quantum field theory (QFT)
            and quantum gravity (QG) using categorical structures. Our approach naturally
            incorporates QG effects into standard QFT calculations through higher-derivative terms
            in the effective action, leading to modified propagators and dispersion relations.
            The framework preserves unitarity and provides a consistent treatment of quantum
            fields on quantum spacetime. We derive specific, falsifiable predictions for high-energy
            physics experiments and gravitational wave observations. The framework suggests a
            smooth dimensional flow from 4D at low energies to lower dimensions at high energies,
            consistent with various approaches to quantum gravity.
