CONCLUSION
----------
The quantum gravity detection framework represents a significant theoretical 
achievement that advances fundamental physics understanding. However, the 
effects are fundamentally undetectable with current technology, limiting 
practical impact. The work provides valuable tools for future research and 
contributes to scientific knowledge, but requires realistic expectations 
about experimental accessibility and practical applications.

The most promising path forward involves focusing on precision improvements 
in quantum optics and electromagnetic measurements, which offer the best 
prospects for detecting quantum gravity effects with future technology 
advances.
